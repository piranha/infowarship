        <h1>If you have a website, you can support Ukraine right now!</h1>

        <p>Not all Russian citizens have the information about what their armed forces are doing in Ukraine, and what casualties they've already experienced.</p>

        <p>Add this script to your website to show a popup for visitors with Russian IP addresses with links to truthful news sources and information about prisoners of war.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>By changing HTML code</h2>
        <p>In your site template before enclosing <code>&lt/body></code> or <code>&lt/head></code> tag add this code:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://infowarship.com/script.js">&lt;/script></code></pre>

        <h2>With GTM</h2>
        <p>If you are using GTM you can add this popup without code change. Create a new tag of type "Custom HTML" and add this code:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://infowarship.com/script.js">&lt;/script></code></pre>

        <h2>That's all</h2>
        <p>After any of those changes visitors from Russian IPs will see popup like this:</p>

        <script>
          function showPopup() {
            var el = document.createElement('script');
            el.src = '/script.js?debug';
            document.body.appendChild(el);
          }
        </script>
        <p class="center"><a class="button" href="javascript: showPopup()">Demo</a></p>

        <h2>What's in the popup</h2>
